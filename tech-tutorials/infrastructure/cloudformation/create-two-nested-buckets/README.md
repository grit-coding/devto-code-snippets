# Create Nested S3 Buckets using AWS CloudFormation via AWS CLI

![flow chart](https://github.com/grit-coding/DevToCodeSnippets/blob/main/tech-tutorials/infrastructure/cloudformation/create-two-nested-buckets/images/flow-chart.png)

This guide outlines the process of creating a CloudFormation nested stack to generate two S3 buckets using AWS CLI and CloudFormation.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI installed on your machine.
- Proper AWS credentials configured with the necessary permissions.

## Configuration

First, configure your AWS credentials by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=yourAccessKey
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YourSecretKey
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

## Steps

1. **Create a Bucket for Your Template**

   Create a new S3 bucket to store your CloudFormation template. Replace `gritcoding-bucketA` with your desired bucket name. Execute the following command:

   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://gritcoding-bucketA --region us-east-1
   # Note: This will fail if the bucket name is not unique.
   ```

2. **Build the CloudFormation Template**

   Change your working directory to where your `main.json` file is located (assumed to be `create-two-nested-buckets`):

   ```bash
   cd create-two-nested-buckets
   ```

   Package your CloudFormation template with the following command:

   ```bash
   aws --region us-east-1 cloudformation package --s3-bucket gritcoding-bucketA --template-file ./main.json --output-template-file ./packaged-template.json --use-json
   ```

3. **Create a CloudFormation Stack**

   Deploy your packaged template to create the CloudFormation stack. This step will set up the nested S3 buckets specified in your template.

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation deploy --template-file ./packaged-template.json --stack-name <your stack name>
   ```

4. **Verify Stack and Bucket Creation**

   After deploying the stack, verify its creation in the AWS Console. Check both the CloudFormation and S3 sections to ensure that the stack and the nested S3 buckets have been successfully created.

5. **Delete a CloudFormation Stack**

   To remove the CloudFormation stack, use the following command.

   ```bash
   aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name <your stack name>
   ```

## Additional Information

The main purpose of this guide is to demonstrate the creation of a CloudFormation nested stack, which in turn will create two S3 buckets.
